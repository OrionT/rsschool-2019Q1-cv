### Personal summary

> I have worked in service companies for several years, but now  I'm focusing on software development - to be more concrete in javascript and mainly in Front-end technologies. Having some experince in it (I have developed web-interfaces for saas-products of my companies where I worked), I want to significally level-up my carrer. Ready to get a new job and immediately dive into new tasks and challenges. I hope that background and experience I already have will help me in it.
